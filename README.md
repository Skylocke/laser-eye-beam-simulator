helping you pretend you have laser eye beams

## what?
this is a first-person shooter game for your smart phone that can be played with or without a VR peripheral.

... so long as your phone is compatible, anyway.

## why?
laser eye beams are cool but also not possible in current reality, which I'm sure many consider unfortunate.

## how?
all visual assets are built via the HTML framework [A-Frame](a-frame.io), and vanilla JavaScript is used to DOM-manipulate the crap out of them in 3-D space.

## things to do
- figure out how to enable cursor-clicking in VR mode.
- improve enemy movement paradigms and possibly add different other sorts
- make the menu less linear (may require additional a-frame component scripts)
- figure out phone compatibility if at all able on my end (vs. on the library's side)
